This guide walks you through the entire process from opening the tool to interpreting results, helping you verify your recovery phrases with confidence.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">The interface is intentionally minimal, focusing on the essential task of word validation. Everything you need is presented on a single page, with clear visual feedback that makes results easy to understand at a glance.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Step-by-Step Usage Guide</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Begin by navigating to the validator page. You will see a large text area with a prompt to enter your seed phrase words separated by spaces. Simply paste or type your recovery phrase directly into this field.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">The tool accepts phrases in any format. You can paste words separated by single spaces, multiple spaces, or even place each word on its own line. Mixed capitalization is perfectly fine—the validation process handles all these variations automatically.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Once your phrase is entered, click the Validate button or simply wait a moment. The tool processes input continuously, providing immediate feedback as you type or paste.</p> <h3>Understanding the Results</h3> <ul class="svelte-1al8b51"><li class="svelte-1al8b51">Green items indicate words found in the official BIP39 list</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">Red items highlight words not present in the standard dictionary</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">A summary message appears at the top stating All words are valid or indicating how many invalid words were found</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">Each word is listed individually with its validation status</li></ul> <h3>Common Scenarios</h3> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">If all words appear in green with the message All words are valid, your phrase uses only official BIP39 words. This is a good sign, though remember this tool does not verify checksums.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">If any words appear in red, double-check your original backup. Common causes include transcription errors, autocorrect changes, or confusion between similar words. Correct the flagged words and validate again.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Tips for Best Results</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Always verify against your original written backup rather than memory. Work in a private, distraction-free environment. Consider validating phrases multiple times to catch any oversights.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1al8b51"><summary class="svelte-1al8b51">Do I need to enter words in order?</summary> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">No. The validator checks each word independently. Order does not matter for wordlist validation.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1al8b51"><summary class="svelte-1al8b51">Can I validate partial phrases?</summary> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Yes. Enter as many words as you wish to check. The tool works with any number of words.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1al8b51"><summary class="svelte-1al8b51">What if I have extra spaces?</summary> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Extra whitespace is automatically handled and ignored during processing.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1al8b51">Mastering basic validation builds confidence in managing your cryptocurrency recovery phrases securely.</p></article> <footer class="mt-5 pt-4 border-top text-center"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary">&larr; Back to Blog Index</a></footer></div>');function C(m){var e=B();k("1al8b51",g=>{var o=_(),y=c(b(o),6);p(4),d(()=>r(y,"content",`${i??""}/blog/posts/post3`)),f(()=>{w.title="Getting Started with the Validator | BIP39 Validator Insights"}),n(g,o)});var a=t(e),v=t(a);p(4),s(a);var l=c(a,4),u=t(l);s(l),s(e),d(()=>{r(v,"href",`${i??""}/blog`),r(u,"href",`${i??""}/blog`)}),n(m,e)}export{C as component,G as universal};
