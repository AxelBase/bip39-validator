It does not perform full BIP39 validation, including checksum verification or seed derivation. This focused approach serves important privacy and usability goals.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Full BIP39 validation requires reconstructing the binary entropy from the mnemonic and verifying the embedded checksum. While useful, this process effectively exposes the complete seed phrase to the validation logic. In a web-based tool, even client-side execution raises potential concerns for highly security-conscious users.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Privacy First Design</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">By avoiding any attempt to interpret the phrase as a whole or derive keys, the tool minimizes risk. Users can confidently check individual words without worrying that the full mnemonic is being processed in ways that could theoretically be intercepted or logged.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Many users only need to verify that their transcribed words are correct members of the wordlist. This is especially common when writing down a new seed phrase or double-checking a backup. Word-by-word validation catches the majority of transcription errors without requiring full reconstruction.</p> <h3>Specific Use Cases Addressed</h3> <ul class="svelte-1li990r"><li class="svelte-1li990r">Verifying newly written backups while the original phrase is still visible</li> <li class="svelte-1li990r">Checking individual suspicious words during recovery attempts</li> <li class="svelte-1li990r">Practicing seed phrase entry without risking full exposure</li> <li class="svelte-1li990r">Teaching others about BIP39 without demonstrating complete recovery</li> <li class="svelte-1li990r">Quick sanity checks before proceeding to wallet-specific recovery tools</li></ul> <h3>Complementary to Full Validation Tools</h3> <p class="svelte-1li990r">This tool is not intended to replace comprehensive BIP39 libraries or wallet recovery software. Instead, it fills a niche for safe, preliminary checks. Once all words are confirmed valid, users can proceed confidently to trusted wallet software for final recovery and checksum verification.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">When Full Validation Is Still Needed</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Remember that wordlist membership alone does not guarantee a valid seed phrase. The BIP39 checksum ensures the phrase corresponds to valid entropy. Always use your wallet's official recovery process as the final step.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">Is wordlist validation sufficient?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">For catching transcription errors, yes.
