The validator highlights these in red, making them easy to spot. Understanding why words appear invalid and how to correct them is essential for maintaining access to your wallet.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Invalid words almost always result from human error during transcription or entry. The official BIP39 wordlist contains exactly 2048 carefully chosen English words, each unique in their first four letters. Any deviation from these exact words will trigger an invalid flag.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Common Causes of Invalid Words</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Typos are the leading cause. A single misplaced letter, such as typing abandun instead of abandon, immediately makes the word invalid. Similarly, transposing letters or adding extra characters creates mismatches.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Autocorrect and predictive text features on mobile devices frequently change words without notice. Words like zoo might become too, or ability might become ability with unintended corrections. Always disable autocorrect when writing down or entering seed phrases.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Confusion between similar-sounding or similar-looking words also occurs. For example, mixing up there and their, or confusing words that look alike in handwriting, such as island and Iceland.</p> <h3>Other Frequent Issues</h3> <ul class="svelte-led0iy"><li class="svelte-led0iy">Adding plural forms: most words in the list are singular; adding an s often invalidates them</li> <li class="svelte-led0iy">Capitalization mistakes: while the validator is case-insensitive, some users worry about mixed case affecting validity</li> <li class="svelte-led0iy">Extra punctuation: accidental hyphens, apostrophes, or periods attached to words</li> <li class="svelte-led0iy">Language mix-ups: accidentally using words from another language's wordlist</li> <li class="svelte-led0iy">Reading handwriting errors: misinterpreting letters like r and n, or o and a</li></ul> <h3>How to Fix Invalid Words</h3> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Always refer back to your original written backup as the source of truth. Compare each flagged word carefully against what you originally recorded. Make corrections directly in the validator and re-check until all words appear green.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">If the original backup is unclear, consult the full BIP39 wordlist available on the wordlist page of this site. Search for similar words that match what you intended. The unique four-letter prefix system helps narrow down possibilities quickly.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Prevention Strategies</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Write seed phrases in a quiet, focused environment. Read each word aloud as you write it. After completing the backup, validate it immediately using this tool while the phrase is still displayed by your wallet.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">Can a word be close but still valid?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">No. Only exact matches from the official list are accepted. Near-matches are treated as invalid to prevent errors.</p></details> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">What if I cannot resolve an invalid word?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Never guess. Return to your wallet's original seed generation screen if possible, or use a trusted recovery process. Guessing risks permanent loss.</p></details> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">Should I rewrite my entire backup?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">If multiple errors exist or handwriting is unclear, creating a fresh, verified backup is recommended.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-led0iy">Quick identification and careful correction of invalid words prevent recovery failures and protect your assets.</p></article> <footer class="mt-5 pt-4 border-top text-center"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary">&larr; Back to Blog Index</a></footer></div>`);function S(m){var e=_();I("led0iy",v=>{var o=k(),g=c(f(o),6);p(4),d(()=>t(g,"content",`${r??""}/blog/posts/post4`)),w(()=>{b.title="Identifying and Fixing Invalid Words | BIP39 Validator Insights"}),n(v,o)});var s=a(e),u=a(s);p(4),i(s);var l=c(s,4),y=a(l);i(l),i(e),d(()=>{t(u,"href",`${r??""}/blog`),t(y,"href",`${r??""}/blog`)}),n(m,e)}export{S as component,C as universal};
